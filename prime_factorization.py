# Definitions:
# prime number: natural number that is divisible by 1 and itself, excluding 0 and 1.
# m√∂bius number:
# perfect power: natural number whose prime factorization consists of just 1 unique prime with arbitrary multiplicity.
# squarefree: natural number whose prime factorization consists of distinct primes.
# n-smooth number: natural number whose prime factors are all less than or equal to n.
# k-rough number natural number whose prime factors are all greater than or equal to k.

# Parameters
# ----------
N = 1000000 # Examine all natural numbers smaller than or equal to N
